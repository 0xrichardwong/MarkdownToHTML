# Markdown to HTML Converter

This Python script converts Markdown content from a specified file to HTML format and saves the result in another file. It utilizes the `markdown` library to perform the conversion, making it easy to generate HTML files from Markdown documents.

## Usage

To use the script, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the script file (`md_to_html_converter.py`) to your local machine.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory where the script is located.
5. Execute the script with the following command:

   ```bash
   python mdToHTML.py

By default, the script will convert Markdown content from the file specified in the inputPath variable (test.md) and save the HTML output to the file specified in the outputPath variable (output.html).

    Once the script is executed, you can find the converted HTML file in the specified output directory.

Requirements

    Python 3.x
    markdown library (install via pip install markdown)

Customization

    You can modify the inputPath and outputPath variables in the script to specify different input and output files, respectively.
    For more advanced customization, you can explore additional options provided by the markdown library for Markdown to HTML conversion.
